Search engine for the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io). Sniffs the DHT gossip and indexes file and directory hashes.

Metadata and contents are extracted using [ipfs-tika](https://github.com/ipfs-search/ipfs-tika), searching is done using OpenSearch 7, queueing is done using RabbitMQ. The crawler is implemented in Go, the API and frontend are built using Node.js.

The ipfs-search command consists of two components: the crawler and the sniffer. The sniffer extracts hashes from the gossip between nodes. The crawler extracts data from the hashes and indexes them.

## Contributors wanted
Building a search engine like this takes a considerable amount of resources (money _and_ TLC).
If you are able to help out with either of them, do reach out (see the contact section in this file).

## Roadmap
For discussing and suggesting features, look at the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs-search/ipfs-search/issues).

## External dependencies

* Go 1.16
* OpenSearch 2.3.x
* RabbitMQ / AMQP server
* NodeJS 9.x
* IPFS 0.7

## Internal dependencies

* [nsfw-server](https://github.com/ipfs-search/nsfw-server)
* [ipfs-tika](https://github.com/ipfs-search/ipfs-tika)

## Building
```bash
$ go get ./...
$ make
```

## Running

### Docker
The most convenient way to run the crawler is through Docker. Simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the crawler, the sniffer and all its dependencies. Hashes can also be queued for crawling manually by running `ipfs-search a <hash>` from within the running container. For example:

```bash
docker-compose exec ipfs-crawler ipfs-search add QmS4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMiUhyvMcX9Ba8nUH4uVv
```

### Ansible deployment
Automated deployment can be done on any (virtual) Ubuntu 16.04 machine. The full production stack is automated and can be found in it's own [repository](https://github.com/ipfs-search/ipfs-search-deployment).
