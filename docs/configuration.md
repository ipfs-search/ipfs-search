# Configuration

Configuration can be done using a YAML configuration file, or by specifying the following environment variables:
* `IPFS_API_URL`
* `IPFS_GATEWAY_URL`
* `OPENSEARCH_URL`
* `AMQP_URL`
* `AMQP_MESSAGE_TTL`
* `TIKA_EXTRACTOR`
* `OTEL_TRACE_SAMPLER_ARG`
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT`
* `HASH_WORKERS`
* `FILE_WORKERS`
* `DIRECTORY_WORKERS`
* `SNIFFER_LASTSEEN_EXPIRATION`
* `SNIFFER_LASTSEEN_PRUNELEN`
* `SNIFFER_BUFFER_SIZE`

A default configuration can be generated with:
```bash
ipfs-search -c config.yml config generate
```
(substitute `config.yml` with the configuration file you'd like to use.)

To use a configuration file, it is necessary to specify the `-c` option, as in:
```bash
ipfs-search -c config.yml crawl
```

The configuration can be (rudimentarily) checked with:
```bash
ipfs-search -c config.yml config check
```
