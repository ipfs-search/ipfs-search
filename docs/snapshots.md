# Snapshots
ipfs-search makes daily [OpenSearch snapshots](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/snapshots/index/) of the indexed data.

We are working towards sharing our index snapshots over IPFS through [Filebase](filebase.com). Until that time, our index snapshots are publicly available over S3/HTTPS and can be loaded directly into an OpenSearch or OpenSearch cluster with sufficient disk space.

As of the time of writing (April 4, 2022) the full index is about 20 TB.

## Restoring
Our snapshots can be configured as a [read-only URL snapshot repository](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/current/snapshots-read-only-repository.html) into a OpenSearch 7 (or later) or OpenSearch cluster. In order to do so, configure the following URL as the repository: https://ipfs-search-snapshots-v8.s3.filebase.com/

### Steps
1.  Ensure that an OpenSearch 7+/OpenSearch cluster with sufficient disk space is available at `localhost:9200`.
2.  Add our repository URL to the `repositories.url.allowed_urls` setting in `opensearch.yml`:
    ```yaml
    allowed_urls: ["https://ipfs-search-snapshots-v8.s3.filebase.com/*"]
    ```
3.  Restart your cluster for the config changes to take affect.
4.  Configure our snapshot repo as a read-only URL repository:
    ```sh
    curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/ipfs_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "type": "url",
      "settings": {
        "url": "https://ipfs-search-snapshots-v8.s3.filebase.com/"
      }
    }
    '
    ```
5.  List available snapshots:
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_snapshot/ipfs_search/_all?pretty"
    ```

    Reference: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/snapshots/get-snapshot/

6.  Pick a *succesful* snapshot (substitute `<snapshot_id>` from the available snapshots above) from the list and start restoring it:
    ```sh
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_snapshot/ipfs_search/<snapshot_id>/_restore?pretty"
    ```
    **WARNING**: This initiates a large transfer and will take a considerable amount of time! Make sure you have a fast & reliable connection!

    Reference: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/snapshots/restore-snapshot/

7.  Track progress of running snapshot restore task:
    ```sh
    curl "localhost:9200/_recovery/"
    ```

Once recovered, you should have *all* of our data available. As long as you don't make updates, future restores should be incremental and, hence, a lot faster.
